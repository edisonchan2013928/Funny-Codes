# Description of our NKDV code
To compile our code, please use the shell script file (call_NKDV.sh). Unfortunately, since the size of the Github page is small, we do not attach the datasets here. If you would like to run our code, please download the point datasets (cf. references in Table 4) and utilize the software OSMNx (Ref. [11] in our paper) to extract the road network from different regions, Seattle, Atlanta, San Francisco and New York.

In existing work, Chan et al. (Ref. [14] in our paper) have developed the system, called IKDV-SYS, to visualize the COVID-19 cases efficiently, in which we think that it is meaningful. In our future work, we plan to develop the system, based on this code, to visualize the COVID-19 cases in the road network.
